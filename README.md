# Bamboo Nuxt 3 Project

Welcome to Bamboo Nuxt 3 repository âœ¨

INTRO:

Wouldn't it be fantastic to ride a custom-made bamboo bike while helping the environment? Okey Omulu is the founder of "bbb - bamboo bikes bern," Switzerland's most ecological bicycle. Bamboo is farmed and processed in the area. When compared to a traditional steel bike, a bbb-bike saves CO2 emissions by 75%. Furthermore, because bamboo absorbs five times more CO2 than other tree species, the real footprint will be significantly lower. Okey is a business owner as well as an expert bicycle builder who has always been concerned with humanitarian and environmental issues. He is originally from Biafra, Nigeria, and has been in Switzerland since 2010. He now wants to move closer to his aim of combining his love of the environment with athletics.

This repository is just for this Project.
